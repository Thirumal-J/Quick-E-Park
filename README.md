# Quick-E-Park
Quick-E-Park aims at helping the German citizens by easing down challenges in the existing parking ticket system. This project is a web application for online parking ticket system which offers various features such as pay and park online, online parking ticket extension online, parking ticket expiry notifications for both users and checkers and so on.
# Initial Assumptions: 
We assume that all the parking areas are controlled by a single body (city
council) or otherwise the individual controlling bodies will work for mutual benefit.
# Key Advantages:
* Single pay and extend parking tickets online for multiple parking areas.
* Online validation for checkers.
* No hardware investment for stakeholders.
* No queue up in front of the machine and eco-friendly (Paperless).
* Notification to users and checkers before parking tickets expire.
* Issued fines can be viewed by users and checkers.
* Online documentation and storage of the transactions.
